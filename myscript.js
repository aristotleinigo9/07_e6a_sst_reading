    question: "<p style = 'color:green'> Passage 1 </p> <p style ='text-align: center'> AT THE CLINIC </p> <p style = 'text-align:justify'>Luis had a headache, a sore throat, a bad cough, and a temperature. He had been sick for five days. Finally, his wife, Martha persuaded him to go to the Furnell University health Clinic. He didn’t have an appointment, so he knew he would have to wait. <p style = 'text-align:justify'> As he entered the clinic, the receptionist asked him to fill out a sign-in slip. He wrote down his name, address, phone number, and I.D. number. Then he checked the reason for his visit to the clinic. He checked 'cold, sore throat'.</p><p style = 'text-align:justify'>Luis waited in the waiting room on the second floor for about twenty minutes. Then, a nurse called his name and Luis followed her into an examination room. She took his temperature and told him the health associate would be in to see him soon. Luis asked the nurse if a health associate was a doctor. She explained that a health associate is not a doctor but has several years of medical education and training. When necessary, health associates consult with the clinic doctors. <p style = 'text-align:justify'>After fifteen minutes the health associate came in. Luis described his symptoms to her. After she had examined him, she told him that his throat was very red, his neck glands were quite swollen, and his temperature was 102 degrees “You’ve got a bad infection, Luis. I’m going to ask the doctor to prescribe an antibiotic for you. Take one capsule three times a day for ten days. You should also stay in bed for two days until your fever comes down. Drink a lot of liquid and rest as much as possible. If your infection doesn’t clear up after five days, come back to the clinic or call me.”<p style = 'text-align:justify'> “Thanks a lot,” said Luis, taking the prescription. He was glad that he had listened to his wife’s advice. On his way home, he stopped at the drug store and had his prescription filled.<p style = 'text-align:justify'> When he got home, he took his medicine and went right to bed. Two days later his temperature was back to normal. By the time he had taken all the pills, he felt like himself again. </p> 1.	Health associates _________________."

    question: "<p style = 'color:green'> Passage 2 </p> <p style ='text-align: center'> THE HIGH COST OF HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES</p> <p style = 'text-align:justify'> The cost of health care in the United States is very high. The time and money that doctors spend on their medical education is probably one reason for this problem.<p style = 'text-align:justify'> A visit to a doctor’s office costs from fifteen to fifty dollars. It is almost impossible for people to pay for the medical care they need. Many people in the United States think that doctors are overpaid. Most doctors, however, disagree. They say that they were required to study medicine for a very long time, first as undergraduates, then as graduate students. Tuition for many years of medical education costs a lot of money. Doctors argue that it is necessary for most medical students to borrow money from a bank to pay their tuition. Because this money must be repaid to the bank, young doctors need to receive a lot of money for their work. So, they charge people high prices for medical care.Therefore, it is possible that the high cost of medical care in America is unnecessary. Because high tuition is one cause of high costs, one way to lower costs would be to have medical schools that are free or have low tuition fees.<p style = 'text-align:justify'>8.

A study showed that this shocking rate of failure is due to a variety of causes some of which are out of the control of the student.

    question: "<p style = 'color:green'> Passage 4 </p> <p style = 'text-align:justify'>During the past five years, the number of Americans killed in car accidents yearly has climbed to more than 55,000. This needless killing on streets and highways can be attributed to three general causes. Mechanical failures, especially those related to faulty brakes and bald tires, account for a large number of fatal accidents. Environmental conditions, such as blind corners, narrow streets, fog, and snow which causes slippery road surfaces also contribute to the horrible accident statistics. However, without question, the most frequently reported factor in car accidents are mistakes in human judgment. These mistakes include things like excessive speeding, failure to signal a turn or a change from one lane to another, and lack of concentration on the part of the driver. The man behind the wheel is often his own worst enemy.</p>18. The three common causes of car accidents, according to the writer of this paragraph, are _______________.",

    question: "<p style = 'color:green'> Passage 5 </p> <p style = 'text-align:justify'>In America, everyone is given a Social Security number. Each person’s Social Security number consists of nine numbers written in a form like this: 308-50-6037. There was a Social Security number, 078-05-1120, that was used a lot before 1977. This was the number on a sample Social Security card that a wallet manufacturer had used to put in each wallet he manufactured in order to show how cards of that size would fit into his wallets. By the way, that number was his secretary’s number. Although the card was marked “SAMPLE”, many buyers of these wallets believed that it was the number assigned to them by the government. Therefore, tens of thousands of Social Security deductions on tax forms were credited to account 078-05-1120. It took 20 years to straighten out the problem. As for the secretary, she was given a new number. Otherwise, among the payments to her account would have been millions of dollars in retirement benefits.</p>21.
